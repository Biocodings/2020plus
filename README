Usage

This project has only been tested on python 2.7.5

The requirements.txt file lists the python dependencies I used for developing
the package.

run.py is the single command line interface for this project.
Type python run.py --help for details.

NOTE: Run run.py while in the same directory. Because of package imports,
running from a different directory may cause an import error.
